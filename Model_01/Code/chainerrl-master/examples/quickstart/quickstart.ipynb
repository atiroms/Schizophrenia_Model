    "To use [DQN (Deep Q-Network)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature14236), you need to define a Q-function that receives an observation and returns an expected future return for each action the agent can take. In ChainerRL, you can define your Q-function as `chainer.Link` as below. Note that the outputs are wrapped by `chainerrl.action_value.DiscreteActionValue`, which implements `chainerrl.action_value.ActionValue`. By wrapping the outputs of Q-functions, ChainerRL can treat discrete-action Q-functions like this and [NAFs (Normalized Advantage Functions)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00748) in the same way."
